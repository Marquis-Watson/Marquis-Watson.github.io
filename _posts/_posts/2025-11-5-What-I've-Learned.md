What We’ve Learned About Tumor Mutations Through Genomic Sequencing
Cancer happens when DNA inside our cells becomes damaged in ways that break the normal rules of growth and repair. With modern genomic sequencing, scientists can now read every letter of a tumor’s DNA to see which genes are mutated and how those changes drive cancer.
Key Terms Made Simple
• SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism): A single “letter” change in DNA. In cancer, similar single-letter changes—called somatic mutations—can cause cells to grow uncontrollably.
• Driver Gene / Mutation: A change that causes cancer growth. These are the main culprits.
• Oncogene: A normal gene that, when mutated or overactive, turns a healthy cell cancerous.
• Passenger Mutation: A random mutation that tags along but doesn’t drive the cancer.
What Sequencing Has Taught Us
According to major 2013 studies by Vogelstein et al. (Science) and Garraway & Lander (Cell):
• Tumors contain hundreds to thousands of mutations, but only a few (about 2–8) are true drivers.
• These drivers affect common pathways that control cell growth, survival, and DNA repair.
• Some genes, like TP53 or KRAS, are “mountains” found mutated in many cancers, while others are rare “hills.”
• Even though each tumor looks genetically unique, many disrupt the same key cellular systems.
Why It Matters
By identifying driver mutations, scientists can:
• Design targeted therapies that hit cancer’s weak points.
• Personalize treatment to each patient’s specific mutation pattern.
• Understand how tumors evolve and why they resist drugs.
The Big Picture
Cancer genomics has revealed that while every tumor carries countless mutations, only a few truly matter. Finding and understanding those few drivers gives us the best chance to predict, prevent, and precisely treat cancer.
